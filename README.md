## Voxel Glass

Voxel Glass is an open-source AR device designed for research and educational purposes. The project includes two versions of the device: Voxel Glass and Voxel Glass Mini. The main difference between them lies in size and the number of supported sensors: the standard version allows for more sensors to be installed, while the mini version is more compact and features one touch button instead of three physical buttons.

## About the Project

This project was developed with the aim of uniting and creating a community of enthusiasts for collaborative work on AR headsets. As part of this initiative, the Voxel One headset was created, which will continue to be modified and developed by the community over a long period of time.

The device's architecture is based on Arduino microcontrollers, making it more accessible to users and promoting openness and friendliness towards the development of their own AR applications.
